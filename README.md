Precision Baking: AI for Accurate Ingredient Measurement in Grams
Online recipe platforms often list ingredients in vague measurements like "cups" or "spoons," which can lead to inconsistent results, especially in professional baking. This lack of precision frustrates bakers and affects the quality of their baked goods.

Objective:
Participants are tasked with developing AI-powered tools that convert recipe measurements into precise grams. Solutions should include a database of ingredient densities, real-time conversion algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring accurate and consistent results for all bakers.
